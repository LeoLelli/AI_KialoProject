Discussion Title: PS5 v Xbox Series X/S, what's better?

1. The Xbox Series X/S is better than the PS5.
1.1. Pro: Scalpers are selling the [Series X/S for a cheaper value](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1311&_nkw=xbox+series+x&_sacat=0) [than the PS5](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1311&_nkw=ps5&_sacat=0).
1.1.1. Con: Buying from scalpers can be risky if the seller is untrustworthy. It is better to buy from an authorized dealer.
1.1.2. Con: This might indicate that the PS5 is worth more since it is a better console.
1.1.2.1. Con: At the same time, this may have nothing to do with the quality of the two consoles but merely with the respective supply, for example as a consequence of production issues.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: It has been verified more PS5s are produced and sold \([7.8m](https://www.techradar.com/news/ps5-production-is-ramping-up-over-the-summer-but-will-it-fix-the-supply-shortage)\) than XSX \([5.8m](https://www.denofgeek.com/games/xbox-series-x-ps5-2021-console-war-sales/)\)
1.2. Con: Sony Worldwide studios outputs a [great amount of polished AAAs every year](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sony_Interactive_Entertainment_video_games), and is recognized having the best developers around, [working in the best conditions](https://insomniac.games/insomniac-again-named-one-of-best-workplaces/) even [recently](https://www.greatplacetowork.com/certified-company/1000651).
1.2.1. Con: This large output of high quality games often comes at a price with developpers [leaving the boat.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/sony-s-obsession-with-blockbusters-is-stirring-unrest-within-playstation-empire)

1.3.1.1. Pro: A console's value also comes from the experiences you cannot have anywhere else. [Good IPs](https://www.ign.com/articles/playstations-major-franchises-tracking-the-years-since-new-entries) as well as specific hardwares such as [PS VR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_VR) are great examples.
1.3.1.2. Con: Exclusive titles make accessibility quite difficult, especially with the limited availability of consoles.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: The fact a game is available exclusively to a platform is a competitive advantage for the platform, not a drawback.
1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Good exclusive titles on failed consoles like the Dreamcast or Virtualboy are quite unavailable for users.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1. Con: While valid for dead consoles, this does not apply to Playstation's IPs, as [Playstation has dominated the market](https://www.sie.com/en/corporate/data.html) [since the brand was created back in 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_game_consoles).
1.3.2. Pro: The Series X/S has [support for more older titles](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/backward-compatibility) [than the PS5's limited compatability](https://www.ps5home.com/ps5-specs/#:~:text=PS5%20Specs:%20%20%20%20Component%20%20,%2016GB%20GDDR6/256-bit%20%206%20more%20rows).

1.4.3. Con: Ever since Microsoft bought out Bethesda, [big things are coming for Bethesda's hits](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/e3).
1.4.3.1. Con: While Bethesda has some decent track records in the past, recent debacles have plundered their reputation. Games that were critically aclaimed haven't sold well \(Arkane Studio games\), and high profile games have been killed by critics and users \(Fallout 76\).
1.5. Con: The PS5 offers the new DualSense controller which has been described as a "[game changer](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/21551307/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-playstation-impressions-hands-on-battery-life-triggers-haptics)" and "[everything you want to see in a next-gen upgrade](https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-dualsense-controller-review)".
1.5.1. Pro: The [DualSense](https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ps5) controller has improved haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.
1.5.1.1. Con: These additions make the controller inherently more expensive, which can lead to having to replace a PS5 controller be costly.
1.5.1.2. Con: These features take a toll on the controler's battery life.
1.5.1.3. Pro: Adaptive triggers improve the user experience of [playing shooting games](https://www.web24.news/u/2020/08/all-the-advantages-of-dualsense-the-ps5-controller.html).
1.5.1.4. Pro: The haptic feedback allows users to experience [game-like sensations](https://www.web24.news/u/2020/08/all-the-advantages-of-dualsense-the-ps5-controller.html) in real life.
1.5.2. Con: [Drift issues](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/gaming/news/sonys-ps5-dualsense-controller-s-drift-issue-is-a-hardware-problem-71613837778189.html) have been reported with the DualSense controller.
1.5.2.1. Con: These early production problems are often ironed out after a year or two.
1.6. Con: PS5 gives a better audio experience than Series X/S.
1.6.1. Pro: The [PS5](https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/ps5-vs-xbox-series-x-which-next-gen-console-should-you-buy) supports immersive, 3D audio when using a headset.
1.6.2. Pro: PS5 has Sony's new Tempest Engine, which can handle hundreds of sound sources.
1.6.3. Con: Immersive sound will not always make a game better.
1.7. Con: The PS5 console has a better design than Xbox Series X.
1.7.1. Pro: The PS5 design is futuristic.
1.7.1.1. Con: The design of the console forces a lot of parts to be external and not be flush with the design, such as seen with the disc drive.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: In this day and age, playing physical copies of games are a dying trend, which is apparent in most digital-only/digital-prefered consoles.
1.7.2. Con: Xbox has a minimalist black box design that looks classy.
1.7.2.1. Pro: The minimalistic design reduces the cost to manufacture the Series X, reducing its retail price.
1.7.3. Con: The console's appearance makes no difference to the gaming experience.
1.7.4. Con: It is difficult to ascertain what an objectively better design is. It largely depends on people's subjective preferences of what they consider aesthetically pleasing.
1.7.5. Con: -> See 1.7.1.1.
1.8. Con: The PS5 is the only gaming console on the market to [properly support VR](https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/ps5-vs-xbox-series-x/#section-vr).
1.8.1. Con: PSVR is reliant on a quite antiquated technology, especially with the motion controls, which are at least [10 years old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Move).
1.8.2. Con: Some Gamepass games accessible from PC are [also VR compatible](https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/jxk2md/all_free_xbox_game_pass_for_pc_vr_games/).

1.8.4.1.1. Con: Just like for the PS4, the PSVR2 will release on a much later date in this console's generation.
1.9. Pro: Xbox Series X/S offers greater value for money than PS5.
1.9.1. Pro: The Series X/S [has greater specs](https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-series-x-specs#:~:text=Xbox%20Series%20X%20Full%20Tech%20Specs%20%20,%20Holiday%202020%20%2011%20more%20rows%20).
1.9.1.1. Con: Great specs are meaningless if multi-platform games ultimately are optimized to also run on other, lower-specced platforms.
1.9.1.2. Con: Hardware alone does not reveal how well a game may function; optimization may be a large factor, such as seen with [buggy experiences on Ark: Survival Evolved](https://www.reginout.com/help-center/fix-ark-survival-evolved-lagging/).
1.9.1.3. Pro: With the greater specs, games like Forza Horizon 4 and Halo Infinite will run at maximum performance.

1.9.1.5.1.1. Con: In the case of boosted performance ps4 games \(with ps5 hardware\), it is a free of charge backward compatibility.
1.9.1.5.1.2. Con: Owners of the PS5 non-disk variant can run every PS4 digital purchase they made on PS4 with a boost option.
1.9.1.5.1.2.1. Con: This still blocks owners who specifically purchase physical copies of games.
1.9.1.5.1.2.1.1. Con: These users still have the choice to purchase the non-digital ps5
1.9.1.5.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The PS5 digital goes for $399, $100 less than the PS5 with disc drive, forcing many on a budget to have to go for the digital edition.
1.9.1.6. Pro: Peripherals for the Xbox provide way more [accessibility for disabled users](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/may/17/microsoft-xbox-disability-friendly-adaptive-controller) than PS5 peripherals.
1.9.1.7. Con: PS 5 offers better [storage](https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/ps5-vs-xbox-series-x-which-next-gen-console-should-you-buy#section-xbox-series-x-vs-ps5-specs): 825GB of storage with a raw 5.5GB/s throughput.
1.9.1.8. Con: The gap in real-world [performance](https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/ps5-vs-xbox-series-x-which-next-gen-console-should-you-buy#section-xbox-series-x-vs-ps5-specs) between Series X and PS 5 is negligible.

1.9.3.2. Con: Both consoles are [priced similarly](https://www.whathifi.com/advice/ps5-vs-xbox-series-x-power-features-pricing-and-controllers-compared). The price of the PS5 is only hiked up because of a stock shortage due to high demand. When the shortage is eliminated, the prices will go back to being roughly the same.
1.9.4. Pro: Xbox offers access to the [Gamepass](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass) which provides enormous value.
1.9.4.1. Con: While it is very consumer friendly, GP is not a sustainable model for larger AAA games, and someone will have to foot the bill at some point. It is considered by many as a potential threat to the industry.
1.9.4.1.1. Con: GP sustainability main driver is based on attracting and retaining a user base. Once it has grown large enough base, users are likely to stick around, especially if they have already purchased additional contents.
1.9.4.1.2. Con: The subscription price is only an entry point. The main revenue driver will be additional paying contents and DLCs.
1.9.4.1.2.1. Con: Subscription models have their games popping in and out of the catalog. This can be a major problem for users having purchased additional contents, finding themselves with a lot of purchased DLCs with no base game to play them on.
1.9.4.1.3. Pro: Driving the cost down on development in general to attract consumers means less creativity in title development, less risk-taking, assets reuse as well as potential technical debt in the long run just to remain afloat.
1.9.4.1.3.1. Con: Microsoft has a big enough treasure of war to support the mony effort without compromizing the quality of the proposed games.
1.9.4.1.4. Pro: Most subscribtion services in general media industry have raised their price once their userbase is either locked in their ecosystem or has reached a certain number.
