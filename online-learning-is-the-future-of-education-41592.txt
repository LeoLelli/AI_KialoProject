Con: Many [elders have lower compliance compared to youth](http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol18/iss3/art10/)(Age correlates with noncompliance), [even regarding their own safety](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0231076)(Even in health settings), anyways. They merely [prefer to blame technology and complex interfaces](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00031/full)(Reasons quoted include because the task is boring or hard or the interface is confusing.).
1.5.5. Con: The gap described in this article is that poorer nations cannot educate their citizens while wealthy countries can \(because of COVID\). A future with robust online education would actually close this gap.
